#Team Use for start
Things to consider:
  What background image will we default to if they choose to play snake witout using image creator;
  making opiton to only make image and not play game?
  
  Gen. Outline (what needs to be done):
    GUI - Megan;
    Photomosaic Logic - Bryan;
    Script to get and store photos from tv shows offline;
    Build database to store these;
    Script to auto resize images to be squares for photmosaic;
    Snake logic;
    
Overall idea:
  Gui will hae menu that allows play to create new image or play snake on default;
  User inputs image;
  Create Photomosaic of images of selected show from offline (in DB);
  Inverse colors on photomosaic image so that we can have the snake be that color;
  Set image as background of snake game;
  Play snake game; 
  Return to menu;
